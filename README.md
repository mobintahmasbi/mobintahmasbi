## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
- 💻 Backend-focused developer with deep experience in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.  
- 🏗 Skilled in **NestJS**, **ExpressJS**, and **Next.js** — building scalable, maintainable systems.  
- 🔍 Passionate about **web security**, **hacking techniques**, and **defensive programming** to make apps safer.  
- 🌱 Always learning through **real-world projects** rather than just tutorials.  
- 🌏 Based in a high-inflation economy, so I **design resilient business solutions** for unstable environments.  
- 🧠 Strong believer in independence — I often build things from scratch rather than relying too heavily on libraries.

## 💡 Philosophy  
> *"Build systems that are not just functional — but bulletproof."*  
I believe that understanding **how things can break** is just as important as knowing **how to build them**. My knowledge of hacking techniques and security flaws makes me a better engineer.

## 📌 Current Focus  
- I am currently working on my own project and also keep learning new things about back-end technologies.
